This repo has files to a database that was fetched from a suggestion portal at the [Department of Transportation's website](http://nycbikeshare.herokuapp.com/page/about). It has data from the time the portal was set up, until 12th November 2014.

Used Python to fetch the data and R to analyze it.

I am late in the pushing things to git game. Will make all the files (along with R code) available shortly.

The csv folder in Data contains the various csvs in which the data existed back then. Since the various files are formated differently, the better approach is to access the json version of the data.  But when I worked on the story in November 2014, I used csv and formatted the files to a common standard before merging them. Feel free to play with the different approaches. I will also add a code to scrape the json version. 

Just for curiosity, [this](http://columbiajournalist.org/citi-bikes-brooklyn-wants-more/) is what the story ended up looking like.
